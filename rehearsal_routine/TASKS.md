PROPOSED PF ___ Develop a brief daily HPC "Rehearsal Routine" that runs a quick test job on your cluster, confirms environment dependencies, logs basic resource usage, and outputs a simple success/fail summary (e.g., CPU time, memory usage). Provide a screenshot or short log file each day for a week to ensure the routine is consistent and that your environment is ready for larger HPC tasks. This aligns with your goal of establishing a repeatable HPC practice and ensures you maintain a reliable HPC setup for subsequent data-driven work. .. 900

VERIFICATION PROMPT ___ In your onchain submission (under 1k characters), restate the daily HPC test routine including date/time of runs, CPU/memory usage, and environment checks. In your private verification doc, paste a snippet or screenshot of at least one HPC log from each day, showing the test jobâ€™s success/fail status. Provide a single link or file reference that can be verified later to confirm authenticity. Finally, confirm you repeated the routine consistently for at least seven days.
